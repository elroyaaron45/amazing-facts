<P>Drones are aircraft and are also known by the abbreviation UAS, which is short for 'unmanned aircraft system'. A UAS consists of an unmanned aircraft and its equipment. It can be controlled either by a human being or by an integrated or external computer. Thus, a drone can also be a partly or fully autonomous aircraft.</P>
<P><H4>what are drones used for</H4></P>
<P>Drones now have many functions, ranging from monitoring climate change to carrying out search operations after natural disasters, photography, filming, and delivering goods. But their most well-known and controversial use is by the military for reconnaissance, surveillance and targeted attacks.</P>
<P ><H4>how far can a drone fly</H4></P>
<P>A hobby drone may be able to fly between 20 and 100 yards. Premium consumer drones can fly up to 8 kilometers (4 miles) or 2.5 miles. A typical range for mid-level drone technology is between 400 and 1.5 miles (0.6 to 3 kilometers). Modern, high-end drones range to 8 kilometers (or 5 miles).</P>
<P><H5>can a drone fly in rain</H5></P>
<P>Can drones fly in rain? Generally, drones cannot fly in rain, because – as mentioned – the most fragile and critical part of the drone (the motor and the electrical components) drones are neither water-resistant nor waterproof.</P>
